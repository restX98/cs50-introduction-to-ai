# Breadth First Search (BFS)

The opposite of depth-first search would be breadth-first search (BFS).

A breadth-first search algorithm will follow multiple directions at the same time, taking one step in each possible direction before taking the second step in each direction.

In this case, the frontier is managed as a queue data structure.

### Pros:
- This algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.


### Cons:
- This algorithm is almost guaranteed to take longer than the minimal time to run.
- At worst, this algorithm takes the longest possible time to run.
